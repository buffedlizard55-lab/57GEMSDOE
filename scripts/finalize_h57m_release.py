"""Write the Session-7 run card and the two new audit findings.

Reads only measured receipts written earlier in this session:

* ``evidence/h57m_emission.json``            the emission run (curves + budget)
* ``evidence/h57m_validation.json``          local format preflight of the TIFF
* ``evidence/h57m_uniqueness_certificate.json`` two-reading registry measurement
* ``evidence/gate_universality.json``        blanket-raster / best-known control
* ``evidence/h57m_holdout.json``             evaluator arms for the H57-M lane

It writes ``evidence/run_card_current.json`` (the file the Pages build renders)
and appends IR-S7A-01 / IR-S7A-02 to ``evidence/irregularities_current.json``.
Nothing here re-thresholds a gate or promotes a candidate: the verdict stays
fail-closed because the inherited forward-overlap gate fired.
