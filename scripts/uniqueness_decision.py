"""Decide whether the directed-overlap gate can be satisfied at all.

Parallel-run protocol rule 1 says a submission has drifted into another lane if
*more than 70 % of its dots fall within 3 px of one registry raster's dots*.
A gate that fires for **every possible** submission is not a duplicate test --
it carries no information.  This script measures whether that is the case, by
asking the gate about rasters that the owner has *already submitted and scored*.

Two statistics per registry raster R:

* ``halo_coverage(R)``  -- fraction of the scored footprint lying within 3 px of
  R's dots.  If this is >= 0.70 the forward test is essentially blind: every
  candidate lands inside R's halo.
* ``forward_overlap(X -> R)`` for every X in a panel of rasters that have
  owner-reported live scores, i.e. files that were really uploaded.  If these
  are >= 0.70 the gate would have called those real submissions duplicates of R.

Both the literal (unmodified) verdict and the discriminating-subset verdict are
reported.  Nothing here waives the protocol: it measures it.
