"""Is the inherited uniqueness gate satisfiable by *any* candidate?

The one-directional gate counts the fraction of a candidate's dots that fall
within 3 px (= 300 m) of a registry raster's positive pixels and fires above
70 %.  Some registry rasters are blanket fields: their 3 px Euclidean dilation
covers almost the whole footprint, so *every* candidate that puts its dots on
the geologically plausible part of the grid fires regardless of what it
predicts.  This script measures that property directly instead of arguing it.

It reports, for every raster already measured against a candidate:

* ``support_fraction``  = dots / footprint cells            (representation class)
* ``dil_coverage``      = |dilate(dots, 3 px) & footprint| / |footprint|
                          -- the share of the grid on which the gate fires
                          mechanically for *any* candidate
* ``sliver_fraction``   = 1 - dil_coverage                  (where a candidate
                          could in principle hide)

and then measures the same witness set against the owner's best-known file to
show the obstruction is not a property of our candidate.  Nothing is
re-thresholded: the inherited 0.70 / 0.90 limits are printed unchanged.
